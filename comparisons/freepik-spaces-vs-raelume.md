# Freepik Spaces vs Raelume: Which AI Workflow Canvas Actually Delivers?

Freepik launched Spaces in November 2025, adding a node-based AI canvas to its already massive creative ecosystem. For teams that live inside Freepik's stock library, it felt like a natural extension. But if you need deep model access, 3D generation, or Gaussian splatting, the story gets more complicated.

## Quick Comparison

| Feature | Freepik Spaces | Raelume |
|---------|----------------|---------|
| **Canvas Type** | Node-based, infinite | Node-based, infinite |
| **AI Models** | 36+ image models, 9+ video models, audio + editing tools | 70+ models across all media types |
| **Media Types** | Image, Video, Audio | Image, Video, 3D, Audio, Text, WORLDS |
| **3D / Gaussian Splatting** | No | Yes (WORLDS blocks) |
| **Real-time Collaboration** | Yes | Yes (unlimited team members) |
| **Stock Library** | Massive (Freepik ecosystem) | No built-in stock library |
| **Pricing Model** | Credit-based tiers ($5.75 to $158/mo) | Free tier with credits, paid plans |
| **Free Tier** | Up to 3 Spaces, limited credits | Free credits, no credit card required |

## The Canvas Experience

Both tools use a node-based approach where you connect blocks visually.

**Freepik Spaces** integrates tightly with the Freepik stock library. You can pull in vectors, photos, and templates directly from their catalog. The collaboration features work well, with Figma-style cursors and shared editing.

**Raelume** focuses on giving you access to as many AI models as possible across as many media types as possible. The block system follows the same input/output logic, but the range of what you can connect is significantly wider.

## Model Access

**Freepik** has built one of the largest model libraries in the space. Image side: 36+ models including Flux (with Kontext), Mystic (their own model), Google Imagen, Ideogram, Seedream, Nano Banana Pro, Magnific upscaling. Video: Veo 3, Kling 2.1/2.6/3.0, Runway Gen 4, Seedance, Wan AI, PixVerse 4.5, Hailuo 02, Sora. Audio: ElevenLabs, Sound Effects, Lip Sync API. Plus editing tools: upscaler to 10K, background remover, retouch, reimagine, sketch-to-image, video editor.

That's a serious toolkit. For pure image and video generation with built-in editing, Freepik is hard to underestimate.

**Raelume** offers 70+ models including Flux 2 Pro Ultra, Nano Banana Pro (4K), Kling 3 Pro, Veo 3.1 (4K video), ElevenLabs V3, Hunyuan3D v3 for 3D, Claude Opus 4.6 for text. Where Raelume pulls ahead is media type breadth: image, video, 3D modeling, audio, text generation, and WORLDS.

## The WORLDS Feature

Raelume's WORLDS blocks do something no competing canvas tool offers: Gaussian splatting.

You can:
- Take a 2D image, convert it into a 3D environment using Gaussian splatting
- Add 3D objects to the scene
- Move a virtual camera freely
- Capture 2K to 4K images from any angle

For teams working on spatial content, VR previsualization, or 3D asset pipelines, this is a meaningful advantage. Neither Freepik Spaces nor Krea offers Gaussian splatting as part of the creative workflow.

## Pricing

**Freepik's pricing** can be confusing:

| Plan | Price | Credits/Year |
|------|-------|--------------|
| Essential | $5.75/month | 84K |
| Premium | $12/month | 216K |
| Premium+ | $24.50/month | 540K |
| Pro | $158.33/month | 3.6M |

Credit costs vary: a single image can cost 50-500 credits depending on model and settings. A 9-second HD video eats roughly 2,600 credits. "Unlimited" image generation only kicks in at Premium+, and advanced features still consume credits.

**Raelume** offers a free tier with no credit card required and paid plans for teams.

## Where Freepik Wins

- **Massive model and editing toolkit** - 36+ image models, 9+ video models, full editing suite (upscaler to 10K, background remover, retouch, sketch-to-image, video editor)
- **Stock library integration** - native access to Freepik's massive asset catalog
- **Brand ecosystem** - plugs into image editor, mockup tools, and asset catalog
- **Lower entry price** - Essential at $5.75/month is accessible

## Where Raelume Wins

- **Model depth** - 70+ models across six media types
- **3D and WORLDS** - Gaussian splatting and 3D generation not available in Freepik
- **Collaboration scale** - unlimited team members vs. 3 Spaces on free tier
- **Transparent usage** - no confusing credit tiers

## Who Should Use What

**Choose Freepik Spaces if:** you already live in the Freepik ecosystem, your work centers on 2D image and video content, and you want tight stock library integration.

**Choose Raelume if:** you need access to a wide range of AI models across multiple media types, your workflow includes 3D or spatial content, or you want to avoid juggling credits and subscriptions.

## The Bigger Picture

Each tool makes a different bet:
- Freepik bets on ecosystem integration
- Raelume bets on model breadth and novel capabilities like Gaussian splatting
- Krea bets on real-time interaction

The real question isn't which tool is "best." It's which tradeoffs align with how you actually work.
