# Raelume vs Relume: Clearing Up the Name Confusion

Let me guess: you googled one of these names and ended up finding the other. Or someone recommended "Relume" and you landed on "Raelume." Or vice versa. And now you're wondering if they're the same thing, related products, or just a confusing coincidence.

**Here's the short answer: Raelume and Relume are two completely different products that happen to have similar names.** That's it. They're not competitors, not related, not even in the same category. Just similar names.

This article exists to clear up the confusion once and for all.

## What Is Relume?

[Relume](https://www.relume.io/) is an AI-powered website design tool. If you're building marketing websites, landing pages, or web apps, this is what you'd use.

Relume helps web designers and developers move faster by generating sitemaps, wireframes, and style guides. You describe your company or project, and Relume outputs a complete sitemap with all the pages you need. Then it converts that sitemap into actual wireframes using real, unstyled components.

From there, you can export to Figma, Webflow, or React. Relume has a library of over 1,000 components for these platforms, so you're not starting from scratch. Over 1 million designers and developers use it to ship websites faster.

The workflow is linear: you go from concept (sitemap) to structure (wireframe) to design (style guide) to implementation (Figma/Webflow/React). It's built for website projects, plain and simple.

**Who it's for:**
- Web designers
- Front-end developers
- Digital agencies
- Anyone building marketing websites or landing pages

**What it does:**
- Generates sitemaps from text prompts
- Creates wireframes with real components
- Exports to Figma, Webflow, or React
- Provides a component library to speed up builds

If you typed "Relume" into Google, this is probably what you were looking for.

## What Is Raelume?

[Raelume](https://raelume.ai) is an AI creative workflow canvas. If you're making images, videos, 3D models, or audio for film, advertising, or creative projects, this is what you'd use.

![Raelume Workflow Canvas](https://pbl.raelume.ai/docs/imageblock1.jpeg)

Raelume is a node-based editor where you connect AI-powered blocks to generate and transform creative content. Each block performs a specific task: generate an image with Flux 2 Pro Ultra, animate it into a video with Kling 2.6 Pro, turn it into a 3D model with Hunyuan3D v3, add voiceover with ElevenLabs V3.

Blocks have inputs on the left and outputs on the right. You connect them with edges. Content flows from one block to the next. An image becomes a video becomes a 3D asset, all on one canvas.

![Raelume Upscale Feature](https://pbl.raelume.ai/assets/landing/feature_upscale_after.jpg)

Raelume supports 5 media types (Image, Video, 3D, Audio, Text) across 70+ AI models. The workflow is non-linear: you can branch, iterate, and transform content in multiple directions. It's built for creative exploration, not website building.

The platform includes real-time collaboration with Figma-style multiplayer cursors, a shared project library, and inline comments for feedback. Over 500 creative teams use it to iterate 3x faster than juggling multiple subscriptions.

**Who it's for:**
- Filmmakers and video editors
- Concept artists and illustrators
- Advertising creatives
- 3D artists and animators
- Anyone producing visual content with AI

**What it does:**
- Generates images with models like Flux 2 Pro Ultra and Nano Banana Pro
- Creates videos with Kling 2.6 Pro, Veo 3.1
- Builds 3D models with Hunyuan3D v3
- Produces audio with ElevenLabs V3
- Connects everything in a visual, node-based canvas

If you typed "Raelume" into Google, this is probably what you were looking for.

## Why Do the Names Sound So Similar?

Honestly, just bad luck. Both products launched in the same era when every SaaS tool has a modern, design-forward name that sounds like it could be a sci-fi character. Both start with "Re," both end with "lume," and both use AI.

But that's where the similarity ends. You wouldn't confuse Photoshop with Webflow just because they're both creative tools. Same logic here.

## Which One Are You Looking For?

If you need to **build a website**, you want [Relume](https://www.relume.io/). It's for web designers, developers, and agencies who work in Figma, Webflow, or React.

If you need to **create visual content** like images, videos, 3D models, or audio, you want [Raelume](https://raelume.ai). It's for filmmakers, advertisers, concept artists, and creative professionals who need access to the latest AI models in one place.

**Could you use both?** Sure. If you're building a website (Relume) and need custom media assets for it (Raelume), they'd complement each other just fine. But they're not alternatives to each other. They solve completely different problems.

**Still confused?** Here's the simplest way to remember:
- **Relume** = websites
- **Raelume** = media
