# Krea vs Raelume: Two AI Creative Canvases, Two Different Bets

Krea has become the go-to name in AI creative tools for one reason: real-time generation. With 30 million users and $83 million in funding, they've built something genuinely impressive. But Raelume is making a different bet entirely: model breadth, 3D workflows, and a feature called WORLDS that nobody else has.

## Quick Comparison

| Feature | Krea | Raelume |
|---------|------|---------|
| **Canvas Type** | Real-time + node-based | Node-based, infinite |
| **AI Models** | 50+ (18+ image, 30+ video) | 70+ across all media types |
| **Media Types** | Image, Video, 3D | Image, Video, 3D, Audio, Text, WORLDS |
| **Signature Feature** | Real-time generation | WORLDS (Gaussian splatting) |
| **Standalone Audio** | No (only via video models) | Yes (ElevenLabs V3) |
| **3D Generation** | Stage environments, Hunyuan3D | Hunyuan3D v3, scene composition |
| **LoRA Training** | Yes (built-in) | No |
| **Team Collaboration** | Yes (per-seat pricing at Business) | Yes (unlimited team members) |
| **Pricing** | $9 to $200/month + Enterprise | Free tier, paid plans |

## The Canvas Experience

Both platforms use visual, node-based workflows where you connect blocks and let content flow between them.

**Krea's canvas** centers on immediacy. Draw a rough sketch, and the AI fills it in instantly. Adjust colors, composition, or style, and watch the output update in real time. It feels less like "prompting an AI" and more like playing an instrument.

**Raelume's canvas** is about scope rather than speed. You won't get instant visual feedback, but you get access to more models across more media types. Image, video, 3D, audio, text, and WORLDS blocks all live on the same canvas.

## Model Access

**Krea** aggregates 50+ models from major AI labs. Image side: Krea 1 (flagship), Flux variants, Nano Banana, ChatGPT Image, Ideogram 3.0, Imagen 3/4, Runway Gen-4, Seedream, Wan, Qwen. Video library: 30+ models including Veo 3/3.1, Sora 2, Kling 3.0, Runway Gen-4.5, Hailuo 2.3.

**Raelume** offers 70+ models across six media types: Flux 2 Pro Ultra, Nano Banana Pro (4K output), Kling 3 Pro, Veo 3.1 (4K video), ElevenLabs V3 for audio, Hunyuan3D v3 for 3D, Claude Opus 4.6 for text.

**Key difference:** Krea does not have standalone audio generation. Audio only comes through video models that support native sound.

## Krea's Killer Feature: Real-Time Generation

This deserves credit. Real-time generation is genuinely impressive and something no major competitor has replicated.

Draw a rough sketch, and it transforms into a polished image instantly. Add reference images for style or character consistency, and the AI incorporates them in real time. For concept artists, storyboard creators, or anyone who thinks visually rather than verbally, this changes the workflow entirely.

Krea also offers LoRA training to create custom styles from your own images.

## Raelume's WORLDS Feature

While Krea built its moat around real-time speed, Raelume built something different: WORLDS blocks.

WORLDS uses Gaussian splatting to turn 2D images into navigable 3D environments. You can:
- Take a single image, convert it into a 3D scene
- Add 3D objects to the scene
- Move a virtual camera freely
- Capture 2K to 4K images from any angle

Krea has its Stage feature for 3D environments (launched April 2025), but it works differently. WORLDS goes further with Gaussian splatting for spatial reconstruction and scene composition.

## Pricing

**Krea** uses compute units:

| Plan | Price | Compute Units |
|------|-------|---------------|
| Free | $0 | 100/day |
| Basic | $9/month | 5,000/month |
| Pro | $35/month | 20,000/month |
| Max | $105/month | 60,000/month |
| Business | $200/month | 80,000/month |

Note: Krea 1 costs 8 units, Nano Banana costs 114 units, ChatGPT Image costs 183 units. A Pro plan's 20,000 units goes further with efficient models.

**Raelume** offers a free tier with no credit card required and paid plans with unlimited team members.

## Where Krea Wins

- **Real-time generation** - unique, no major competitor has this
- **Established scale** - 30 million users, $83 million funding, proven stability
- **LoRA training** - built-in custom style training
- **Video model breadth** - 30+ video models including Sora 2, Veo 3.1, Kling 3.0, Runway Gen-4.5

## Where Raelume Wins

- **Media type breadth** - six media types versus three
- **WORLDS and Gaussian splatting** - nobody else has this
- **Standalone audio generation** - ElevenLabs V3 integration
- **Team collaboration scale** - unlimited team members
- **Simpler pricing** - no compute unit calculations

## Who Should Use What

**Choose Krea if:** you think visually and want to iterate by drawing rather than prompting. Real-time generation fundamentally changes the creative loop. Also if you need LoRA training or want the largest video model selection.

**Choose Raelume if:** your workflow spans multiple media types. The WORLDS feature is unique for spatial or 3D content. Also if you need standalone audio generation or want unlimited team members.

## Bottom Line

Krea bet on speed and immediacy. Raelume bet on breadth and novel capabilities. Neither bet is wrong. The question is which tradeoffs align with how you actually work.
