## Overview

Raelume is a visual workflow canvas where you connect AI-powered blocks to create, transform, and iterate on creative content. Node-based editor where each block performs a specific task: generating images, creating videos, building 3D models, or processing text.

## Key Stats

- **70+ AI Models**
- **6 Media Types:** Image, Video, 3D, Audio, Text, WORLDS
- **500+ Creative teams** using it
- **Unlimited team members**

## How It Works

- Each block has **inputs** (left side) and **outputs** (right side) connected with **edges**
- Content flows from one block to the next
- Image block -> Video block (animate it) -> 3D block (create model)
- Text blocks provide prompts to any media block
